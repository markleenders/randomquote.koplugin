# Random Quotes for KOReader

A KOReader plugin that displays a random quote from a large selection of quotes in a small pop-up when you unlock. You can replace these with your own highlighted texts or add new ones to quotes.lua. The plugin can extract \[and maintains\] a local quote library from your highlighted texts, and provides settings to control appearance and behavior of the widget, but then you lose the supplied quotes.

## Features 

- Shows a random quote in a lightweight `QuoteWidget` with basic formatting (bold/\[italic\]/alignment).
- Extracts quoted/highlighted texts from book metadata into the plugin's local library.
- Settings to specify appearance and library directory.

## Installation

1. Install the App Store plugin
2. Search for 'quote'
3. Select either the original Random Quote by DenisovichDev/randomquote.plugin or this one by markleenders/randomquote.plugin.
4. Make sure the plugin is enabled (`Settings Menu -> More Tools -> Plugin Management -> Make sure Random Quote is ticked`)

## Usage

- Open KOReader → More Tools → Random Quote Options.
- Select **Random Quote Settings** provide the location to all your books, and customize the appearance of the widget. 
- If you want your own quotes, use **Extract Highlighted Texts** to scan the configured book directory and add discovered highlights into the plugin's library.
- Try **Debug: Show A Random Quote** to preview a random quote immediately.
- The plugin shows a random quote when resumed or activated, using the configured font and appearance settings.

## Settings

Access these under More Tools → Random Quote Options → Random Quote Settings.

- Title: choose between the default title, no title, or enter a custom title string.
- Font face: select a font face; the plugin attempts to resolve and use the requested face.
- Font size: choose the display size used by the `QuoteWidget`.
- Book directory: path scanned when extracting highlights (default: `/mnt/us/Books`).

## Advanced / Curating the Library

The plugin stores its quote library in the plugin folder as `quotes.lua` and updates it when you run extraction. Advanced users can directly edit the `quotes.lua` if they wish. Placeholders are given in the file in this repo for you to check.

## Troubleshooting

- No quotes shown: run **Debug: Show A Random Quote** to confirm runtime behavior. If extraction found no entries, ensure `Book dir` points to the correct folder and that book metadata sidecars exist.
- Extraction failures: malformed metadata files may prevent extraction; check KOReader logs for errors related to loading metadata files.
- If you are unsure, file an Issue in this GitHub repo.

## Compatibility

- Should work with all compatible devices. I have only checked with my Kobo Clara 2E. 

## License

AGPL-3.0-or-later (same license as KOReader).
